<h2 id="">Website</h2> <p> When you visit our website, we don't collect any
    data and we don't store any cookies.  </p>

<p> Website statistics are utilizing <a
        href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> - a privacy
    friendly web counter without any tracking of personal data.  </p>

<h2 id="">BlenderDMX Addon</h2> 

<p> BlenderDMX Addon runs locally on your computer inside Blender. At no time
    will any of your stored personal data be sent to us or a third party unless
    you initialize the action for example via MVR-xchange.  </p>

<p> BlenderDMX Addon can log debug information to a file. You can set the level
    of debug detail included. If you send the logfile to someone for debugging,
    check that it does not contain private, sensitive, or not-disclosable data
first.  </p>


<h2 id="">MVR-xchange server</h2> 

<p>
You should NOT share private data via the server. The data is not publicly
visible or available, but it is visible to the operators of the server. We will
not share the data, but we want to be sure that a random mistake will not
result in private data exposure.
</p>

<p> We save the provided MVR file - it is a function of the server to receive
    the MVR file and to distribute it in the same group to other clients who
    request this file. We log IP addresses in order to prevent abuse of the
    system. We clean the data (the MVR files and the logs) weekly.  </p> 


<p> Groups in MVR-xchange on BlenderDMX.eu are
    organized via subdomains, where each domain is a very long string in the
        form of a UUID v4. There is no authentication, as the randomness of the
        UUID guarantees (<a
                             href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/53458/is-it-safe-to-rely-on-uuids-for-privacy">discussion</a>) that the chances of someone randomly guessing a v4 UUID are
     infinitesimally small. It's so tiny that it's not worth serious
     consideration, as it would take about 103 trillion guesses if the UUID
     creation is truly random. The choice of the group to be an UUID is our
     implementation choice, it could potentially be any string, but UUIDs
 contribute to robustness of system.  </p>
