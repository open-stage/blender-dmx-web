<h2>BlenderDMX Addon is a garden</h2>
<p>
  This project is the hobby of some random group of people on the internet.
  There is no intent to commercialize it, grow it or expand the target audience
  of it. In fact, there is intent to explicitly not do that.
</p>
<p>
  Think of BlenderDMX Addon as a privately-owned public garden. You can visit it any
  time for free and enjoy it. You can spend time there, and you can bring an
  infinite amount of friends with you to enjoy it. You can walk the pathways
  built there. You can sit on some patch of grass and maybe watch a Duck or
  something. You can leave a tip in the tip jar at the entrance if you really
  enjoy it and want to support it flourish.
</p>
<p>
  You can take inspiration from it and bring that home to your own garden,
  giving it a personal twist and adapting it as needed. You can even make
  friendly suggestions and if you have modified your own garden and it ties
  into the vision that is already in our garden, you may even become one of our
  gardeners.

</p>
<p>
  But, at the end of the day, you must understand that it is still
  privately-owned. You’re on someone else’s property over which you have no
  power at all. You will have to show the necessary respect. And - most
  importantly - you need to understand that letting you into this garden is a
  gift and should be treated as such.
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t like this garden because you don’t like how it’s structured, or
  you feel like it’s missing something, or maybe We choose the wrong flowers to
  plant over there that’s fine. It’s just not for you then. You can leave at any
  time.
</p>
<p>
  There is simply no ground to stand on to demand change to the garden. It
  doesn't matter if it would attract more people or if all the other gardens in
  town are doing something in a specific way. It doesn't matter if your idea of
  what gardens even are differs. This at the end of the day is simply private
  property with free public access as a gift to everyone.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to software development, everyone has access to infinite plots
  of undeveloped land that they can claim at any time. Therefore, a garden being
  build with a specific vision does not take away the ability for anyone else to
  build their own garden with a different vision.
