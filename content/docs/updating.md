Updating the addon will cause all project data to be erased. To preserve the
data, you can use the Project data Export/Import function:

- Use `Setup - Export - Export Project data` to save the data to a zip file
- [Download and install](/docs/installation) the addon
- Use `Setup - Import - Import Project data` to load the data from the previously exported zip file
