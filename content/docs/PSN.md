PosiStageNet (PSN) is an [open protocol](https://posistage.net/) to receive
position information from different trackers connected to a PSN server. In
BlenderDMX Addon, multiple Trackers (PSN server connections) with multiple Tracking
Targets  (PSN slots) can be created and Focus points of moving lights can be
linked to these as followers.
