PosiStageNet (PSN) is an [open protocol](https://posistage.net/) to receive
position information from different trackers connected to a PSN server. In
BlenderDMX, multiple Trackers (PSN server connections) with multiple Tracking
Targets  (PSN slots) can be created and moving lights or any other objects can
be linked to these as followers.
