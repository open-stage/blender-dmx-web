You must have at least one Universe set to Art-Net, to be able to enable it.
When enabling Art-Net, ideally, do not change the IP address settings and leave
it at the default 0.0.0.0 .

### Enabling Art-Net

Create Universe, set it to Art-Net, enable Art-Net Input:

> Note: Art-Net Input can only be enabled if you have at least one Universe set to Art-Net

# Using a console on the same computer

When using an Art-Net source on the same computer, you have to make sure to
start and enable Art-Net **first** in the BlenderDMX.

If running two pieces of Art-Net based software on one computer is not working
for you, then save yourself the trouble and the best is to use another computer
for the sending.


### BlenderDMX and QLCplus via Art-Net on the same computer
