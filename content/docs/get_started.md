### Download and Install BlenderDMX Addon

See dedicated [Download page here](/download).

### Important

Upon `Create New Show` BlenderDMX Addon creates a DMX collection in which the
BlenderDMX data is stored. Fixtures imported from GDTF reside here and these
have their own node trees for them. Manually editing or deleting data from the
DMX collection, in fixtures' geometries or node trees will likely cause the
addon to stop working. Generally, avoid such manual edits.

### Create new show

After enabling the Addon, it shows up at the `3D View` as a `DMX` tab on the
right side, which shows a single panel. If you cannot see the side bar, press
`N`. Start the addon by clicking `Create New Show` in the `DMX` tab.

click OK:

### Setup beams

Make beams visible via menu Setup → Beam Volume → Create Volume Box, to simulate
ambient fog/haze. Make sure to change Viewport to Viewport Shading:

The rendered volumetric beam can be made much nicer, see <a
href="../rendering/" >Beam Rendering.</a> for more information.

### Record keyframe

Keyframe recording in BlenderDMX Addon is in menu Keyframe Recorder:

- Add Keyframe allows to manually insert keyframes related to the fixture attributes, like intensity, color, gobo, beam...
- Auto Keying turns on Blender internal auto-keying + changes to fixtures attributes (intensity, colors, gobo, beam...) are also recorded.
