## Supporting high quality meshes from GDTF

With this release we add support for high quality meshes (if present) in GDTF. Multiple GDTF devices can be imported in both normal and high mesh quality at the same time. MVR Import also allows to set the mesh quality preference.

* Update translation strings
* Allow to use high quality mesh from GDTF
* Enhance detection of virtual channels
* Update primitive model for conventional and PAR64
* Add MVR export options to MVR xchange
* Handle faulty GDTF files during MVR import
