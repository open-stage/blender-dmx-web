# Fixture kinematic chain redesign, color mixer improvements

* Refactor GDTF assembling to use parent child relationship
* Do not fail when removing (perhaps a faulty) fixture
* Ensure a fixture with just a single color mixing can be operated
* Prevent color mixing drifting on refresh
* Translation updates for Italian, Spanish, Portuguese
