#### 1.6.0

Added support for PosiStageNet (PSN) protocol. PosiStageNet (PSN) is an [open
protocol](https://posistage.net/) to receive position information from
different trackers connected to a PSN server. In BlenderDMX Addon, multiple Trackers
(PSN server connections) with multiple Tracking Targets  (PSN slots) can be
created and moving lights or any other objects can be linked to these as
followers. When patching fixtures, the autogenerated name is now based on the
device name. The BlenderDMX Addon gobo in the Moving beam was made nicer, the Blender
logo has been added as a gobo too ðŸ™‚.
