# New Align and Distribute panel, Reworked MVR import, and import/export in Blender menu

To make fixture placement simpler, new Align and Distribute panel has been
added. MVR Import has received a lot of loving care thanks to @nrgsille76 . The
MVR Import/Export and GDTF Import are now available in Blender's Import/Export
menu, the GDTF import allows to patch fixtures right away. When working with
differently bright devices, it is sometimes useful to set the spot light to a
brighter level - new "Multiply beams intensity" settings allows exactly that.
