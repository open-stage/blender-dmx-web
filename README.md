# BlenderDMX.eu

Website sources for https://blenderdmx.eu

## Prerequisites

This website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To build the sources, you need to install it first.

Linux:
```bash
sudo snap install hugo
```

macOS:
```bash
brew install hugo
```

Windows:
```bash
winget install Hugo.Hugo.Extended
```

## Build website

Install NPM dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Compile website:
```bash
hugo
```

The compiled HTML files will be stored in the `public` folder.

Instead of building static HTML files, you can also start a Hugo development server with live reload:
```bash
hugo serve
```

## Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post, run

```bash
hugo new blog/202X-XX-XX-blog-post-name.md
```

This will create a new file `blog/202x-XX-XX-blog-post-name.md` from the `blog` archetype with inserted
boilerplate and some pre-filled frontmatter fields.
